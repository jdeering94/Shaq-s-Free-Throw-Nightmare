Main goal is Space-invaders
MVP - I want to be able to have a swarm of aliens and a ship that can fire back at them
  the loss condition is the swarm reaching the bottom row, the win condition being the aliens are wiped out
  score needs to be displayed
  will be one round long

  Requirements of game grid
    needs to house everything
    needs to have boundaries on all four sides

  Requirements of the alien swarm:
    moves every second in unison, right until it reaches the boundary,
    then down, then left until it reaches the boundary and so on
    the alien swarm needs to drop bombs periodically
    each alien in the swarm needs to interact with cannon fire and disappear when hit
      each hit needs to generate a score
    when the swarm reaches the bottom, it needs to initiate a game over
    potentially add the mothership as well - random event of a ship that flies through
      will probably need to use some similar logic or code to that of frogger i.e. objects created and passed through the game field
  
  Requirements for the spaceship
    needs to be able to move left and right
    needs to stop at the boundaries
    needs to be able to be hit by the alien bomb
    needs to die if hit by bomb

Requirements for game score
    needs to display and update dynamically
    needs to show upon game end

NEEDS TO BE CREATED TO MEET MVP CRITERIA
1. Need to create a game grid
  do that by having a single div in the html, then by adding an array in the JS, 
  then you push a cell into the array, and append it into the DOM
  can then style it using css

2.A Need to create spaceship
  similar to pikachu, can do this by adding a class to a cell
  style it in css to give it a background sprite
  2.B have to add eventlisteners that 'move' it based on key inputs
    'moving' really just means removing the class and adding it to the cell that the key button has said
    this will need to be able to obey the boundaries-use the mathematical method rather than array
  2.C have to add eventlistener for firing a missile
    will use spacebar for this, like the moving function will have to use
    adding/removing classes in order to make it 'move'
    the movement will be based off of a setinterval, moving every such and such seconds until it hits the boundary or an alien
      most likely better to use the mathematical method for establishing boundaries rather than identifying cells
    the missile will need to have collision detection-likely the most complicated part but might be able to reuse for alien missiles
    can only fire one missile at a time, need to wait for first to stop existing before being able to fire again

3. Need to create alien swarm
    same basic logic as creating the ship, although multiple
    will be based off of the same logic as moving the missile, however it s a function that needs to apply to a range of cells
    using setInterval to dictate how often it moves, but it has to be able to be cancelled when it reaches a boundary
      potential hiccup is that the whole swarm has to move as one, so if any cell with an alien class hits the boundary they all have to change their movement
    the direction needs to change when hitting a boundary, and also it needs to move down one row
      could this be doen using switch cases?
    each cell needs to be able to interact with a missile and have its class removed
    needs to be able to randomly fire a missile
      really not sure how to be able to do this
      I imagine maybe a setInterval that targets a random cell and creates a bomb that fires from its position
      this can have multiple bombs at once
      will have to really play with this, is 10% chance too high every 5 seconds?
    Need to add a game over if one member of the swarm reaches the bottom boundary
      this will use similar logic to the left/right boundary 

4. Need to impement a game score
  this is pretty simple, just need to query select an element in the html, and on every alien killed it needs to increment it by a score usinf .innerHTML

5. Need to create win/loss conditions
  on wave being deleted, a win screen
    probably use if any class remains in the array
  Loss condition being if aliens reach border or if spaceship is hit by a bomb
