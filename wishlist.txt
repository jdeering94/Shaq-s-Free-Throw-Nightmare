Non-essential but would like to implement if I have time
1. bunkers that are destructible
  probably quite difficult
2. color scheme
  bottom third all the items green
  middle third white
  top third red?
3. animations
  death animations and also destruction animations on bombs and missiles hitting boundary
4. mothership 
  worth 200 points and obeys path like frogger
  doesn't fire missiles
5. collision for if a missile hits a bomb
6. want to implement multiple rounds
  ideally with a greater difficulty-maybe all that increases is the speed of the swarm?
7. three different types of alien crafts in the swarm
  this might be somewhat straightforward, might just have to be careful with classes
8. potentially make the grid a lot bigger so that the missiles can miss
